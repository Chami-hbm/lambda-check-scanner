# Lambda-Check: An Automated Security and Cost-Efficiency Scanner for AWS Lambda
# Capstone Project Prototype

# This is the main entry point for the Lambda-Check tool. Its job is to orchestrate the scan by calling functions from the other modules.

# --- Imports/Libraries ---
import boto3  # Boto3 is the official AWS SDK for Python.
import argparse  # Argparse is the standard way to create command-line tools in Python.
import time  # Use the time library to track how long our scan takes.
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError  # For handling specific errors from the AWS API.
from tqdm import tqdm   #Import tqdm for the progress bar.
from typing import Dict, Any, List  # For adding type hints.
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed  # This is the library that lets us run our checks in parallel to make the scan faster.

# --- Custom Module Imports ---
# Here, we import the functions we need from our other files.
# This keeps the main script clean and focused on running the scan.
from src.analyzers import security_analyzer, cost_analyzer
from src.reporting import print_console_summary, generate_html_report

# --- Type hint for a Boto3 client object ---
# This just makes our function signatures cleaner and easier to read.
Boto3Client = Any


# --- Core Data Collection Functions ---
# I've kept these two functions in main.py because they are central to the
# script's main workflow of getting the list of work and fetching details for each item.
